# Text Shadow Mouse Move Effect
When the user scrolls a text shadow effect is attached to the *headear* inside a *div* component

## Notes
* HTML gloabl attribute **contenteditable** defines that the content of an element is editable.

    ```html
        <h1 contenteditable>ðŸ”¥WOAH!</h1>
    ```
* Working with **events**:
    - **this** represents the the thing that you are listen on for the event (always the same)
    - **e.target** represents the thing that actually triggered on the event (the same element than above or also could be its children)
    ```javascript
        // When they are not the same we have to calculate
        if( this !== e.target) {                        
            x = x + e.target.offsetLeft;
            y = y + e.target.offsetTop;
        }
    ```
    - Some properties for the measures:
        - **this.offsetHeight**, **this.offsetWidth** 
        - **e.offsetX**, **e.offsetY** 
        - **e.target.offsetLeft**, **e.target.offsetTop** 
        ```javascript
            // Width & height properties of the 'hero' div in relation to the window object
            const { offsetWidth: width, offsetHeight: height } = this;
            // Distance of the mouse from the event's target on both axis
            let {offsetX: x, offsetY: y } = e;
            // If the element that is the current target of the event differs from the event's originating target, 
            // increment the values of the two previously declared variables by the distance between the originating target and the current target on both axis
            if( this !== e.target) {
                x = x + e.target.offsetLeft;
                y = y + e.target.offsetTop;
            }
        ```
        - **walk** variable is used to calculate the stretch distance for the element's shadow on both axis.
        ```javascript
            const walk = 100; // 100px
            const xWalk = (x / width * walk) - (walk / 2);  // Normaliza and then rest half the walk
            const yWalk = (y / height * walk) - (walk / 2); 
        ```
* ES6 destruturing:

    ```javascript
        const width = this.offsetWidth,
              height = this.offsetHeight;
        const { offsetWidth: width, offsetHeight: height } = hero; 
    ```
